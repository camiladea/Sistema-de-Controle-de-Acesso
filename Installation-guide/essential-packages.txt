# ESSENTIAL PACKAGES #

In order to properly run the system you will have to install the following packages in your ARM64 machine.
First, update your system in order to maintain compatibility.

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y




# 1. sqlite3 #

This system uses sqlite3 in order to maintain light and stable performance.
TO install it simply run:

sudo apt install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev




# 2. Glib #

For general use of file compiling and handling compatibility accross ARM64 based systems.
Install with:

sudo apt install libglib2.0-0




# 3. Gobject #

API for fprint that is used by many functions included in libfprint.
Install with: 

sudo apt install libgobject-2.0




# 4. Libfprint 2 & Fprintd #

Main library for reading and implementing fingerprint scanners. Should work globally with any scanner that supports it.
Install with:

sudo apt-get install libfprint-2-2 libfprint-2-dev fprintd libpam-fprintd




# 5. Build Essentials & Others #

Dependency necessary packages, basic for running the system.
Install with:

sudo apt install build-essential meson ninja-build pkg-config




# 6. Lsusb #

Reads and manages connected USB devices.
Install with:

sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev




# 7. Temurin JDK 11 #

This is the only Java JDK that works with our system, and compiles correctly. Other JDKs (Oracle 11 legacy, openJDK 11) have failed to prove viable.
In order to install it, follow these steps.

cd /usr/lib/jvm
sudo wget https://github.com/adoptium/temurin11-binaries/releases/download/jdk-11.0.22%2B7/OpenJDK11U-jdk_aarch64_linux_hotspot_11.0.22_7.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvf OpenJDK11U-jdk_aarch64_linux_hotspot_11.0.22_7.tar.gz
sudo mv jdk-11.0.22+7 temurin-11
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/temurin-11/bin/java 1
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/lib/jvm/temurin-11/bin/javac 1

After running all the commands the JDK should be setup for use.




# 8. C Helper Tool #

In order to communicate with the scanner we use a helper C file that sends the fprint fucntions directly.
To setup the helper follow these steps:


## 8.1. CD into the project folder. ##

use "cd /(path-to-project)/resources"


## 8.2. Compile, move and authorize. ##

Then execute this command to compile, send to the correct compile location, and give it permission to run.

sudo gcc fp_test.c -o fp_test $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libfprint-2 glib-2.0 gobject-2.0) -ldl

sudo mv fp_test /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fp_test


## 8.3. Test it. ##

Run this command to temporarily enroll a fingerprint locally.

/usr/local/bin/fp_test enroll

Copy the base64 output and copy it into a generic txt file (here named test.txt as example).
Then, verify it using:

/usr/local/bin/fp_test verify "$(cat test.txt)"

If it prints 'ok', the helper is properly installed.
