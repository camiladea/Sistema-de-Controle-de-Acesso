# HOW TO START SQLITE3 SERVER #

To start the database to begin enrolling users you need the follow all of these steps,
Make sure you download sqlite3 before doing any of these.





1. CD into the project folder

Use cd in your terminal to enter the project folder using its path.

cd /path-to-system




2. Create the Database.

We have a premade database with a pre-set ADMIN user called "Administrador Padrão",
you may remove and add your own Admin user later using the .sql file (projeto_pi_db_with_digitalTemplate.sql)

To sucessfuly make the database you write the following command into your terminal:

sqlite3 sistema_acesso.db < projeto_pi_db_with_digitalTemplate.sql

And just like that the database is set up and ready to use.




OBS: Any changes to the database (tables, .db name or .sql name) will affect the Java code and possibly break it.
