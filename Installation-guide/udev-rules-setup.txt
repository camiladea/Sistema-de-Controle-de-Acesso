# HOW TO SETUP SPECIFIC UDEV-RULES #

We have a file that tries to get any fingerprint scanners but some have unique IDs that require you to manually add a new
line into the file to support your device.

To fully implement a specific rule for your specific device follow these steps.



1. Edit the .rules file

To insert your own device to the file simply fetch it with:

lsusb

Then use

nano 90-libfprint.rules

And the paste following line with replaced values according to your specific ones,
like this, alongside the others in the file.

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="your vendor id here", ATTR{idProduct}=="your product id here", MODE="0666"

Do CTRL+S and CTRL+x




2. Copy the rules from the resource path to the actual udev path.

Run this command still inside the resources folder:

sudo cp 90-libfprint.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/





3. Reload the rules

Paste these into your terminal to fully reload the rules and apply the changes.

sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
