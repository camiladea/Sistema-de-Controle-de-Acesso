### CONFIGURE UDEV RULES FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS GUIDE ###

## This guide will help with setting up your SDK, Udev rules and running any sample apps or your own application. ##


### 1. Install the desired SDK version into your machine using the link provided in SDK-installation-setup text file. ###

# After installing the .zip file, you must run a update in order to make sure everything is ready and setup for this whole process
# Then, install any dependencies needed, we recommend running the following commands.

~
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev
~

### 2. Extract and Install SDK ###

# Open your terminal and run the following commands to extract the SDK, or do it yourself in any directory of your liking.

~
tar -xvzf eNBioBSP-SDK-Linux-v5.3.0.1.tar.gz
cd eNBioBSP-SDK-Linux-v5.3.0.1
cd eNBSP.5.3.0.1_x64/eNBSP/bin
~

# Install the install.sh file.

~
sudo ./install.sh
~


### 3. Fetch Device ID ###

# Run the following command to fetch all USB devices connected, for this you **MUST HAVE THE SCANNER PLUGGED IN**.

~
lsusb
~

# You are looking for anything with "Nitgen", "Scanner", "Hamster", etc. After located you must locate the device and vendor ID
# Here's and example of what the output of the last command should look like

# Bus 001 Device 005: ID 1c1a:0001 Nitgen Corp.

# Look out for these values: "1c1a" = Vendor ID, "0001" Product/Device ID. These are required to start making the Udev rules.

### 4. Writing the Udev rules file ###

# To start writting the file, execute a nano alongside the file path, name and specific extensions (you MUST use .rules) to open the editor UI

# To execute a nano use the following command with this path.

~
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-nitgen-fingerprint.rules
~

# After that, copy and paste the code from below only changing the vendor and product ID

~
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1c1a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0001", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
~

### 5. Loading and activating new rules ###

# And to end configuring the rules just run the following commands in order to set everything up correctly.

~
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
sudo usermod -aG plugdev $USER
newgrp plugdev
~

### Conclusion ###

# With everything setup you might now want to build your app to run with the scanner or run a sample test from your sdk files.
